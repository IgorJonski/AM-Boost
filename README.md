## About app
App that encourages to take one short training session every morning. User has 3 modes to choose from, each variates by trainingâ€™s time. During training session there are many randomly picked exercises, which are changed every 20 seconds. After training user can keep track of his progress in statistics section. App supports both dark and light mode + Polish and English language (matches device's settings).

### During this project I practiced / learned how to use:
- Multiple language support
- Dark and light mode support
- Timer
- Animated background<br/>
and more!
